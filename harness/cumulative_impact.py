"""Cumulative change audit: base_ref -> chain tip, over EVERY changed file.

The per-checkpoint metrics in :mod:`harness.metrics` are deliberately scoped --
``source_globs`` (production Java), a hotspot subsystem, a wired-node closure.
That scoping is what makes them comparable between arms, but it also means an
agent can hold those numbers down by putting work where the scope does not
reach: YAML wiring, SQL, generated config, class fields, test code.

This module answers the blunt question instead. Diff the branch START against
its FINAL commit -- one diff for the whole run, so intermediate churn collapses
and only the surviving change is measured -- then, for every changed line in
every changed file:

  * find the function at the tip whose body contains it,
  * take that function's cyclomatic complexity,
  * sum CC over the DISTINCT functions touched.

A function is counted once no matter how many checkpoints touched it, because
the question is the complexity of the code that now exists, not the number of
edits that built it.

Lines that land nowhere are the point of the exercise and are reported, never
dropped:

  ``orphan``  - inside a file lizard parses, but outside every function body
                (class fields, static initialisers, annotations, enum bodies).
  ``opaque``  - inside a file lizard cannot parse at all (.yml, .xml, .json,
                .properties, .md). OfficeFloor's wiring lives here by design,
                so this bucket is a genuine architectural difference as well as
                a blind spot -- read it alongside the CC sum, not instead of it.

Both are reported per arm next to the CC sum, together with the same CC sum
restricted to ``source_globs``. The gap between the scoped sum and the full
sweep is the direct measure of how much a scoped metric cannot see.

Usage:
    python -m harness.cumulative_impact --config config.yaml [--run-id ID]
                                        [--json OUT.json] [--top N]
