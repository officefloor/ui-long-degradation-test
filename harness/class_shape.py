"""Class-shape audit: WHAT KIND of class does an arm add to hold a new rule?

`cumulative_impact` answers how much complexity a run added and where it landed.
This answers what it was made of. The two arms are both Spring Boot applications,
so the same vocabulary applies to each, and the interesting differences are the
ones an experienced reader of that framework would notice in review:

  spring-bean     carries a stereotype (@Component/@Service/@RestController/
                  @ControllerAdvice/@Configuration/...). Container-managed, so it
                  can be injected, mocked, proxied and configured.
  static-util     every method is static. Scores beautifully on the structural
                  impact formula (a static method in a small class has near-zero
                  WMC_other) but is procedural: no injection, no seam for a test
                  double, no participation in transactions or AOP.
  instance-class  ordinary object with instance methods. OfficeFloor's wired
                  functions are these -- the framework instantiates them.
  exception       a domain exception, i.e. the rule reports failure by throwing
                  through the app's @ControllerAdvice rather than returning a
                  bare ResponseEntity status.
  entity / annotation / interface / other

The counts are per CHAIN, over classes the run CREATED (present at the tip and
absent from base_ref), excluding generated code (`rest/dto`, `rest/api`). What to
read: a shift between these categories is a shift in idiom, and idiom is the part
of "is this code a competent developer would recognise" that can be counted.
Report the SPREAD, not just the mean -- ten chains from one prompt choosing
different mechanisms is itself the finding.

Methods come from lizard (the harness's pinned parser), never a regex over the
source: a `private static final Map<..> X = Map.of(` line reads exactly like a
static method declaration to a grep, and counting those makes almost every class
look like a static utility.

Usage:
    python -m harness.class_shape --config config.yaml [--run-id ID] [--json OUT]
