# VENDORED from officefloor/spring-petclinic-rest-long-degradation-test
#   harness/parser_selftest.py  (vendored 2026-10-10)
#
# LOCAL CHANGES (port back — the originals have the same gaps):
#   * `require()` and `main()` resolved the gate CLI from config's
#     `impact_gate.cmd` ONLY and returned {} when it was unset. config.yaml
#     leaves it commented out and relies on impact_gate.default_cmd(), so the
#     gate probe silently never ran: run 202610100208 recorded
#     `parser_probe: null` for all 250 checkpoints. Both now resolve via
#     impact_gate._cmd(cfg), which falls back to default_cmd().
#   * `check_gate` adapted to this repo's impact_gate.score(worktree, layer,
#     cfg, timeout) signature (the sibling's takes cmd/percentiles directly).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
"""Fail-closed Java-parser self-test for both measurement stacks.

WHY THIS EXISTS. lizard 1.24.0 regressed its Java state machine: a *bare*
annotation immediately followed by a *parenthesised* annotation at class level
(``@Entity`` then ``@Table(name = "owners")``) loses the second ``@`` in
``JavaStates._state_post_decorator`` — it returns to ``_state_global`` without
re-dispatching the token — and the class declaration is then consumed as if it
were a method body. The file yields ZERO functions. Nothing errors; the file is
simply not there any more.

WHAT THAT COSTS. Every structural metric is function-based, so an unparsable file
silently reads as "no complexity, no change". In the sibling arm this hid 11% of
the arm's impact mass and let 6 of 78 changes that should have failed the gate
pass instead — and it did so ASYMMETRICALLY between arms, biasing exactly the
claim the run exists to test.

TWO STACKS, CHECKED SEPARATELY. They are two different installs and can drift:

  * this harness's in-process lizard  -> every metric in ``metrics.py``/``analyze``;
  * the ``impact-gate`` CLI's own venv -> every verdict of the ``gated`` condition.
    A gate graded against a baseline measured by a *different* parser is not
    comparing like with like, so both stacks must agree.

The check is a change of exactly the failing shape — a method added to an
annotated entity class — asserted end to end: the parser must see the new method,
and the gate must score that change above zero. Fails CLOSED, like the Landlock
self-check: a silently blind measure is worse than no run at all.

Run standalone:

    .venv/bin/python -m harness.parser_selftest --config config.yaml

Exit codes: 0 = PASS, 1 = FAIL (a parser is blind — do NOT run the experiment).
